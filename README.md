# [Project 2: Forecasting Gold Prices](https://github.com/AB-3/Gold-Forecast)
For this project I utilized data on available on goldhub.org and the ARIMA forecasting model to predict the prices of gold.
I also ran diagnostics, to evaluate the fit of the model, and calculated the mean squared error, utilizing a chunk of the data to calculate the Mean squared error, receiving a Mean squared error of 33.74
