+ Utilized Foursquare API to leverage location data in order to determine optimal location and type of restaurant to open in Zurich, Switzerland

+ Used Python programming language and its libraries such as PANDAS to scrape, clean and explore data

+ Developed a K-Means Clustering model and analyzed frequency of venues

+ Used Folium library to map clusters and understand which data points to use

# [Project 2: Forecasting Gold Prices](https://github.com/AB-3/Gold-Forecast)
For this project I utilized data on available on goldhub.org and the ARIMA forecasting model to predict the prices of gold.
I also ran diagnostics, to evaluate the fit of the model, and calculated the mean squared error, utilizing a chunk of the data to calculate the Mean squared error, receiving a Mean squared error of 33.74

# [Project 3: Does reach impact the outcome of an MMA bout?](https://github.com/AB-3/MMA-Data-Analysis/blob/main/fighter_reach.ipynb)
For this project I scraped data  from [UFC stats](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/fighters), using the python libraries, Beautiful soup and requests, cleaned the data using Pandas and Numpy libraries, and conducted analysis and visualization using  seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, and statsmodel libraries. The purpose of this project was to examine the relationship with fighter reach, and the win to fights ratio.

# Project 4: scraping and visualizing fighter stats
coming soon
